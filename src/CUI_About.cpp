"zTracker Prime is a fork of the original zTracker project from 2001, which was a clone of Impulse Tracker, itself a clone of Scream Tracker. The original zTracker was developed by Christopher Micali until 2002.\n"

"It had become my go-to software for composing music, so I forked it in 2003. Over 20 years later, it remains my primary sequencer, and as of 2024 I continue to work on it.\n"
